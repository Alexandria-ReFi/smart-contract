Edna had not spoken to Robert since his return from Mexico.

She had caught one fleeting glimpse of him when he came in with his mother late upon the night of his arrival.

She had wanted to seek him out that night, but something—indefinable fear, perhaps—had withheld her.

She had promised herself that the next day she would meet him face to face, and so express the candid truth that was in her heart.

But when the next day came, he was not at the pension.

He had taken himself off somewhere, and Edna waited for him all day.

It was only in the evening when she was walking down the long path toward the beach that she saw him leaning idly against one of the supports of the gallery.

He was watching her as she approached.

She could see it in the dim light of the stars, and her heart beat fast with a vague expectancy.

She did not know what she expected or what she was saying as she spoke to him.

'Are you glad to be home again?' she asked, holding out her hand to him.

'Very,' he answered simply, taking her hand and holding it for a moment.

She did not withdraw it.

'Did you think of us sometimes in Mexico?'

'I thought of you,' he said.

She was not prepared for that answer.

It startled her, and for the moment, she was confused.

She withdrew her hand and looked away, out toward the dark horizon where the sky and the Gulf met in solemn solitude.

She could feel his eyes upon her, searching, questioning, and she longed to tell him all that was in her soul.

But the words would not come.

A sudden constraint had fallen between them.

They walked together toward the beach in silence.

The night air was soft and warm, and the faint murmur of the sea filled the stillness.

Edna felt as if she were drifting away on a great tide of emotion that she could not control.

She wanted to reach out, to grasp something tangible, something real.

But everything was slipping away from her.

Robert turned to her suddenly and said, 'I must go in. It is late.'

She looked up at him quickly, as if about to speak, but instead, she only nodded.

'Goodnight,' he said.

'Goodnight,' she whispered.
