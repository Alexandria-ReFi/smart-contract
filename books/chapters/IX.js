Every light in the hall was ablaze; every lamp turned as high as it could be without smoking the chimney or threatening explosion.

The lamps were fixed at intervals against the wall, encircling the whole room.

Someone had gathered orange and lemon branches, and with these fashioned graceful festoons between.

The dark green of the branches stood out and glistened against the white muslin curtains which draped the windows, and which puffed, floated, and flapped at the capricious will of a stiff breeze that swept up from the Gulf.

It was Saturday night a few weeks after the intimate conversation held between Robert and Madame Ratignolle on their way from the beach.

An unusual number of husbands, fathers, and friends had come down to stay over Sunday; and they were being suitably entertained by their families, with the material help of Madame Lebrun.

The dining tables had all been removed to one end of the hall, and the chairs ranged about in rows and in clusters.

Each little family group had had its say and exchanged its domestic gossip earlier in the evening.

There was now an apparent disposition to relax; to widen the circle of confidences and give a more general tone to the conversation.

Many of the children had been permitted to sit up beyond their usual bedtime.

A small band of them were lying on their stomachs on the floor looking at the colored sheets of the comic papers which Mr. Pontellier had brought down.

The little Pontellier boys were permitting them to do so, and making their authority felt.

Music, dancing, and a recitation or two were the entertainments furnished, or rather, offered.

But there was nothing systematic about the program, no appearance of prearrangement nor even premeditation.

At an early hour in the evening the Farival twins were prevailed upon to play the piano.

They were girls of fourteen, always clad in the Virgin’s colors, blue and white, having been dedicated to the Blessed Virgin at their baptism.

They played a duet from “Zampa,” and at the earnest solicitation of everyone present followed it with the overture to “The Poet and the Peasant.”

“Allez vous-en! Sapristi!” shrieked the parrot outside the door.

He was the only being present who possessed sufficient candor to admit that he was not listening to these gracious performances for the first time that summer.

Old Monsieur Farival, grandfather of the twins, grew indignant over the interruption, and insisted upon having the bird removed and consigned to regions of darkness.

Victor Lebrun objected; and his decrees were as immutable as those of Fate.

The parrot fortunately offered no further interruption to the entertainment, the whole venom of his nature apparently having been cherished up and hurled against the twins in that one impetuous outburst.

Later a young brother and sister gave recitations, which everyone present had heard many times at winter evening entertainments in the city.

A little girl performed a skirt dance in the center of the floor.

The mother played her accompaniments and at the same time watched her daughter with greedy admiration and nervous apprehension.

She need have had no apprehension.

The child was mistress of the situation.

She had been properly dressed for the occasion in black tulle and black silk tights.

Her little neck and arms were bare, and her hair, artificially crimped, stood out like fluffy black plumes over her head.

Her poses were full of grace, and her little black-shod toes twinkled as they shot out and upward with a rapidity and suddenness which were bewildering.

But there was no reason why everyone should not dance.

Madame Ratignolle could not, so it was she who gaily consented to play for the others.

She played very well, keeping excellent waltz time and infusing an expression into the strains which was indeed inspiring.

She was keeping up her music on account of the children, she said; because she and her husband both considered it a means of brightening the home and making it attractive.

Almost everyone danced but the twins, who could not be induced to separate during the brief period when one or the other should be whirling around the room in the arms of a man.

They might have danced together, but they did not think of it.

The children were sent to bed.

Some went submissively; others with shrieks and protests as they were dragged away.

They had been permitted to sit up till after the ice-cream, which naturally marked the limit of human indulgence.

The ice-cream was passed around with cake—gold and silver cake arranged on platters in alternate slices; it had been made and frozen during the afternoon back of the kitchen by two black women, under the supervision of Victor.

It was pronounced a great success—excellent if it had only contained a little less vanilla or a little more sugar, if it had been frozen a degree harder, and if the salt might have been kept out of portions of it.

Victor was proud of his achievement, and went about recommending it and urging everyone to partake of it to excess​
