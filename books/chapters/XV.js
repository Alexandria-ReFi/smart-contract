When Edna entered the dining-room one evening a little late, as was her habit, an unusually animated conversation seemed to be going on.

Several persons were talking at once, and Victor’s voice was predominating, even over that of his mother.

Edna had returned late from her bath, had dressed in some haste, and her face was flushed.

Her head, set off by her dainty white gown, suggested a rich, rare blossom.

She took her seat at table between old Monsieur Farival and Madame Ratignolle.

As she seated herself and was about to begin her dinner, she perceived that Robert was not there.

She had not seen him during the afternoon; she had not seen him since the morning.

She began to wonder why he had left Grand Isle so suddenly and so unexpectedly.

'No; at least, that is, I don't remember one.'

Edna pushed her plate aside and laid down her fork.

She looked around the table at the faces that seemed to stare at her.

Victor laughed softly.

'You look as if you had just been struck a stunning blow, Mrs. Pontellier. What's the matter?'

Edna did not answer.

She got up and walked away, leaving her dinner untouched.

She went out on the porch and down to the beach, pacing back and forth with slow, even steps.

The night was dark and still, with a breath of salt in the air.
